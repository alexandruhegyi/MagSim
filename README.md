# MagSim
Two lightweight Python utilities for exploring archaeological magnetic‐field decay. 


AirSim_Storbekken1_Norway.py ingests a magnetic-gradient GeoTIFF (default Mag.tif, or any mag raster), builds two user-configurable cross-profiles, upward-continues the field through a list of sensor heights with an FFT kernel, sprinkles realistic Gaussian soil noise, extracts the minimum and maximum anomaly inside each profile corridor at every height, fits effective power-law decays, prints tidy summary tables to the console, and exports a multi-panel PDF plus interactive plots that visualise the maps, decay curves and profile heat maps; edit the “USER SETTINGS” block near the top to point to your raster, choose sensor heights, profile geometry, noise level and colour stretch, then run python AirSim_Storbekken1_Norway.py under Python ≥3.8 with NumPy, SciPy, Rasterio and Matplotlib installed. KilnSim.py is a fully synthetic forward model: it represents a buried, uniformly magnetised circular kiln as an array of point dipoles, adds a linear soil-slope trend, smoothed subsoil heterogeneity and instrument noise, performs FFT upward continuation from 0.2 m to 15 m, records the global peak at every height, fits a single power-law exponent, and generates publication-ready figures—including tiled Bᶻ maps with a red profile line and 3-D kiln inset, stacked horizontal profiles, a peak-decay curve, a height-versus-x heat map and an optional volumetric rendering—whose styling can be tuned via the parameter block at the top of the file; run it with python KilnSim.py, ensuring the same SciPy/Matplotlib stack plus mpl_toolkits.mplot3d (bundled with Matplotlib) is available.
